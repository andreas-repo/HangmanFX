# HangmanFX

A personal side project of me. It's a hangman game programmed in java and javafx. At the moment its only a simple game which hasnt been styled etc.
The game randomly chooses a word from a list and if you guess the correct word displays a win screen and then starts the game again. If you guess 12x wrong you loose.
The pictures are only standins until the game is finished and i add new better game art and style the javafx elements.
